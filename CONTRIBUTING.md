# Contributing

Create your local git branch and rebase it from the shared master branch. Please make sure to rebuild your local database schemas using the migrations (as illustrated in the Database Setup section above) to capture any latest updates/changes.

When you are ready to submit a pull request from your local branch, please rebase your branch off of the shared master branch again to integrate any new updates in the codebase before submitting. Any developers joining the project should feel free to review any outstanding pull requests and assign themselves to any open tickets on the Issues list.
